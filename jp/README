The code is contained in two files: stripStopWords.js and testStripStopWords.js

The function can be used by importing the stripStopWords.js file as follows:

var stripFunction = require('./stripStopWords');

Then, the function itself may be called as:

stripFunction.strip_stopwords(languageCode,inputText);

To run the tests for this function, simply run:

node testStripStopWords.js
